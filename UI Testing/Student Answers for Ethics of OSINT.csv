,,,,,,,,,
4,2,Yes,1,"Yes, generally it looks fine and serviceable.",5,1,The articles page just vomits a bunch of links on the page with no names or descriptions.,Add more descriptive documentation for the articles page.,None to say.
4,1,"Sort of, although it just gave interesting places to visit rather than a trip itinerary like I expected.",2,Yes,1,3,"Needing to actually click the submit button to send a query is a bit inconvenient, but not the worst. Also, the articles linked on the page appear a bit sketchy and it's hard to tell what they are for.",Maybe being able to hit the enter button to submit queries?,"This is a really cool program! Most of the time, it gave what appeared to be pretty acurate answers to the questions I gave it."
1,1,"Sort of. It gave me information about places to visit in China and good routes to take. However, it didn't tell me how to get to China.",1,Yes.,4,2,Some of the functions of the different pages are unclear. Especially the article page. It was also unclear what the LLM page was until you started messing around with it.,I would suggest adding a short description to each page to describe its function.,"It was easy to use and visually clear. I would suggest adding more personality to it though. Maybe make it feel more ""China-like""."
3,3,Yes.,1,"It looks kind of basic, and it could use a better design to not make the whole page kind of empty.",5,2,"The design. It is just too basic, and the articles section is confusing, and the documenation page could use some pictures along with some bold text for the truly important details.","I would reccomend making the website have more of a brand, and having that brand built into the design of the website in every way. It could also use some helpful, popup instructions that explain what something is and why.",none
6,5,The response was in Chinese so I didnf know what it says,1,It's not optimized for mobile users which should be an easy fix. The header just needs to be formatted and the internal text in the body paragraph as well clips out of the page.,7 having a short description can go a long way,2 not a lot of effort but some patience,It looks too barebones and the image of the vegetables or whatever at the top is distracting,Spend some time making it more use friendly and adding in more description as to what the purpose of the site and its functions are,"It's very simple but I think the actual implementation is difficult because given you're trying to do OSINT into Chinese sources, its greatest strength is that it's in Chinese, which is a difficult language for most westerners to translate. Therefore, if you want your project to really work you would need it to properly translate or display the information in a way that makes sense for the user."
4,1,"Relevant, yes. Useful? Not really.",1,"yeah, genearlly pleasing",2 - they are well named,"1 - this doesn't seem to have anything to do with osint, but it's easy to use.",It doesn't seem to have any direct connection to osint. It seems like a private LLM with support to create your own.,"Not sure, but maybe have an about page that clearly explains what this website i intended to do.",ngrok is sketch
3,1,it provided several different ideas so yes,1,It looks relatively clean if a little unpolished,3,2,The UI needs a bit more work to look professional and the information on how to use everything and its purpose could be clearer.,I think adding more descriptions on operation and tooltips would be the most helpful. Maybe when you highlight the different tabs it gives you a little info box.,great job keeping things simple
7,4,Yes very,Super easy! Clarifying that you only need to inlude the english would be useful.,"It's fine, nothing bad, but not a lot there.","I had a pretty ahrd time udnerstanding what it was, I have only a little experience with how LLMs actually work so i didn't know what to do witht he pages I saw. 7",Once I had it explained to me I would say like a 2.,Text on the website explaining how it works and why would really be beenficial.,The programs eems to work great> Adding a word then searching worked very quickly,"Maybe move the restart wordlist buttom to the bottom of the wordlist, it's current spot is begging to be clicked by accident."
8,8,I got a few destinations... I don't know how usefull they'd be,3,It's not bad,2,4,The query box is not the best at interpreting what I put in,A bit more instruction on how to search and what the results are,"even when my result had no results, I still got a bunch of articles at the bottom, I don't understand that"
1,1,"Yes, assuming I'm asking it to plan an itinerary. It gave me a list of attractions to visit with descriptions and articles.","I added ""video games made in europe"", and it was easy. 1 out of 10.",Yes. If I were using it in the dark I might be dissapointed that there is not a dark mode.,"The documentation (how to download and set it up) was pretty in depth and well documented. Because this process would be confusing to people who are not as tech literate, I would say it isn't as easy. But with all tabs included, probably a 3/10.",1. Extremely easy to use and straightforward.,Loading time is a bit long. That is pretty much it.,"Perhaps add a dark mode. Instead of hiding it behind some settings, maybe a switch at the top of the cite.",It works great! It didn't have anything about Tiananmen square haha.
8,4,"Yes, it had answers to my question and relevant info about a trip to china",2,"Yes, overall it is pleasing",6,5,"The articles page is just a list of links, maybe break them up by explaining relevance","The articles page is just a list of links, maybe break them up by explaining relevance. I don't get why it says 'enter query here' when its just a text prompt, that language made me think i needed code like an SQL query.",Maybe an intro page describing what it is supposed to do/purpose.
2,2,"Tt listed out big sights to see, but did not really give steps for cities, activities, or travel arrangements.",2,Yes,5,7,I do not understand what articles is.,I do not understand the vegetable people logo.,N/A
4,5,"For the most part. I asked it about legal considerations regarding foreign visitors coming to China, and the tool indicated that ""the provided texts don't offer specific details""","2. Not hard, although I have no idea what the word list is or does.","Generally, yes.","7 - I think the ""Query LLM"" seems to be something like ""I've shoved all of these article contents into an LLM (hopefully without exceeding its content window). Let's discuss the contents"". ""Word List"" seems to allow me to insert words (and get the Chinese equivalents of them?) but is unclear why you would care to do that.",3,"There seems to be a lot of missing context - why are these features there, and how am I supposed to use them?","The site's logo isn't clickable, so I can't navigate to the 'home' context like I naturally would do. Put a paragraph blurb before the ""query LLM"" and ""word list"" apps explaining what the feature does and why it exists. Add more documentation than just ""here's how to install it"". Have the ""articles"" tab contain more metadata about the article than just a single column of hashes. What about ""date scraped""? or ""how often this article has been queried/referenced/used""? I imagine a search feature could also be helpful for articles.",(I have no additional feedback)
2,1,"Yeah, somewhat. It basically generated a list of popular destinations to visit it China. It didn't generate anything about where to stay, or travel/lodging related. Just places that would be cool to see.",2,"Yes, it's simple and not confusing.",5,2,It isn't intuitive to me what the Word List or Articles pages are for.,"Maybe a short description on each page of what it's for/how to use it. The Documentation page was great at this, and the Query page was easy enough to know right away, but only because I was told before visiting the site what it's general purpose is. If I hadn't known that prior to using the site, I wouldn't have known what type of query to send.",This is a very cool project! Nice work.
6,4,Yes,2,sure,5,5,it's a little slow,a welcome screen,none
5,2,"Yes. It was giving me general recommendations, but nothing too specific. Still helpful.",2,"Yes, generally. It is simple yet effective",5,2,"While the content is there, its hard to know what the content is exactly without clicking on it. Especially with the articles tab.","Adding more subtext to each tab, especially . Also, in the word list, instead of having the user scroll down to the new word, it should do it for them. Just a few ideas.",No feedback other than what has been said.
8,3,More or less,3,"It doesn't look bad, just not super intuitive",8,5,It lacks descriptions for each page as well as any sort of instruction,Please add instructions/descriptions to the page,Some more colors for the buttons would also be nice
6,7,"Yes, everything was relevant to the query that I submitted.","2, this process seems easy, however, I'm not sure the use of it, or why I should bother with this.","Yes, it has a clean appearance.","9, it is quite difficult to gather what each page is doing, and how they contribute or interact with one another.","9, Without specific instructions I would be lost as to what is expected. Even with the instructions I am not clear as to the exact function of this site or why it is useful.",Unclear purpose with too few indicators of what is possible. Time is valuable and I would like to understand why I should spend my time here instead of doing something else.,A short paragraph tying the idea together so users can understand why this is worth their time.,"The design is very clean, however, it seems to take this idea too far in simplifying what could be a great idea."
5,6,8,3,8,3,4,"Little slow, jumping between pages can be hard.",Don't love the UI but it was easy enough to use so not a huge problem.,Seems cool. Add some colors.
3,1,Yes it was.,"3. I typed in a word and it appeared with its Mandarin translation at the end of the wordlist, but it's not clear what the purpose of the word list is.",Yes,"6. I'm not exactly sure still what the word list and article list are for, and I have some prior knowledge of the program from what was talked about in class.",1. The program was easy to use once I understood it.,"I wish I could directly search the articles collected. I tried to query the LLM to find articles that mentioned certain things, but the answers weren't useful.",Explain what everything does. Make the titles of the articles into real titles.,N/A
2,1,9,1,"eh, somewhat.",6,2,Lack of clarity of what is is and does,You need to connect the whole thing together and explain how the different features relate.,Add a home page.
2,2,Yes,1,Yes,1,2,Probably the design - it can be updated for more ascetically pleasing graphics,Maybe put the purpose of the program on the home page,I think its a pretty neat tool!
3,3,The answer was mostly relevant.,3,"It looks good enough, but also plain.",4,4,Initial orientation to the program.,"Instead of a long string of characters, maybe have article names under articles.",I think it's on the right track.
4,2,yes,1,yes it is,1,7,just that there is very minimal design to it.,adding a discription to it so users not in this class can know what it does,
5,2,Somewhat,1,Yes,7,3,I don't really understand what I'm interacting with and what the pages are for. Only reason I know anything about it is from what was said in class.,Documentation font shouldn't all be monospace- reserve it for commands. Generally the format of that page could be improved. Provide a landing page that explains what the website is.,What is the articles page?
